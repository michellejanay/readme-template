# Template Readme

Hi! This is a readme template I made following FreeCodeCamp's 'How to write a good readme' article. <br >

Here are some guide questions that will help you out: <br >
What was your motivation? <br >
Why did you build this project? <br >
What problem does it solve? <br >
What did you learn? <br >

# Installation

[comment]: <> (Use the example in your original project readme)

Once you've forked the project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:
```bash npm  run  dev
# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm  run  dev  --  --open
```  

### Building
To create a production version of your app:
```bash npm  run  build```
You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.
> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.

## Usage
In this section you will describe to users how to use the project, or how to contribute.
